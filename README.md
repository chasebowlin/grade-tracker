<h3 id="abstract">Description</h3>

This application was design off of the idea that it is better to keep of your own grades so that you can cross check them with what the professor assigned you. The idea also came from the lack of updates on online portals by professors which can leave someone in the blue about what their grade is actually in the class. 

This Android app allows user to assign up to eight classes either weighted or unweighted. For each of the classed assigned. The user can also break down how grades are evaluated into different sections (aka homework, test, quizes, etc) and assign a weighted percentage to each of them. They are also able to assign assignments to each of the sections as well as several things important to the assignment like due date and points possible.
